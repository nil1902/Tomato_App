## Why "User Already Exists" is GOOD News

This error means:
1. ✅ Network is working
2. ✅ App connected to server
3. ✅ Server responded correctly
4. ✅ Database query executed
5. ✅ Email was found in database

The only "problem" is you're trying to register an email that's already registered!

## What to Do Now

### 1. Login Instead of Register
```
1. Click "Already have an account? Login"
2. Enter your email: bappapal156@gmail.com
3. Enter your password
4. Click "Login"
5. You're in! 🎉
```

### 2. Or Create New Account
If you want to test registration:
```
1. Use a different email (not bappapal156@gmail.com)
2. Example: bappapal157@gmail.com
3. Enter password
4. Click "Create Account"
5. Verify email if required
```

1. ✅ Added Windows network libraries (winhttp.lib, ws2_32.lib, crypt32.lib)
2. ✅ Created custom HTTP client for Windows
3. ✅ Configured SSL certificate handling
4. ✅ Added HTTP overrides in main.dart
5. ✅ Increased connection timeout

### Proof It's Working
- "User already exists" error = Server communication successful
