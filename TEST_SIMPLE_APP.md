# 🧪 Testing Simple Version

I've created a SUPER SIMPLE version of the app to test if it works on your Android 16 phone.

## What I Did:
- Removed ALL complex code
- Removed authentication
- Removed routing
- Removed all screens
- Just shows a pink heart icon and "LoveNest" text

## Why:
This will tell us if the problem is:
1. Android 16 compatibility issue
2. OR something in your app code

## 📱 Install This Test Version:

1. **Uninstall the old app** from your phone
2. **Copy the new APK**: `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\zomato_app\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`
3. **Install on your phone**
4. **Open the app**

## ✅ If This Works:
You'll see a pink heart and "App is working!" text.
This means Android 16 is fine, and we need to fix something in the full app code.

## ❌ If This Crashes Too:
Then it's an Android 16 or CMF Phone compatibility issue, and we'll need to adjust build settings.

**Please install this test version and tell me what happens!**

Your original code is safely backed up in `lib/main_backup.dart` - I haven't destroyed anything! 🙏
